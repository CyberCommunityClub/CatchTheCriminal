**Nolaaa:** Hey ya'll! Is anyone getting this?

**Kenny:** Yooo, I got ya your text loud and clear.

**Glan:** Howdy!! I'm checking out this new chat room. How's everyone doing?

**Kynz:** 10/10 - working on some plans but not too much otherwise.

**Kenny:** Yeah, been fishing out here in the ocean recently. It's been really nice out and perfect for it.

**Fily:** Ooh, any particular place that's good to fish in the ocean?

**Kenny:** I usually like to go quite a bit from shore cuz that's where more fish seem to be.

**Fily:** Gotcha. I usually stay on land to stay in touch with parkour and graffiti.

**Glan:** I'd have to agree. I've been wanting to get a nice car so I can cruise around the city. I just have a general interest in cars so that's been fun.

**Nolaaa:** Ayyyeee, at least the ocean and land is a bit different from my original planet.

**Glan:** Which planet did ya come from **@Nolaaa**?

**Nolaaa:** I moved from Zuliqua to Earth. Quite the difference I must say.

**Kynz:** Oh how cool! Anyone interested in purchasing a bracelet? I have a really nice one that I'm looking to sell.

**Glan:** Potentially. I don't have cash quite yet so give me some time.

**Kynz:** No worries - but looking to sell it fairly quickly so get back to me asap.
